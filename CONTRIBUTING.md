# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Nodebug.me (and sorry for the mess).
The project needs your help! Please contribute if any of the following are true:

1. You have ops experience
2. You have dev experience
3. You have design experience
4. You are enthusiastic and want to help with a simple Hapi website

If you're thinking of making a pull request, please keep the following things in
mind:

1. Small bugfix pull requests are always welcome. "Small" here is to mean that
you've noticed a specific problem and are introducing a solution specific to that
problem.
2. Large, structural changes should be discussed ahead of time in a separate
issue. If large changes are requested without a discussion, the collaborators
on this repo are unlikely to merge it.
3. If you don't know how big the solution will be, open an issue to discuss it!
The collaborators are happy to help, and we want your input.

By making an issue before making large changes you not only greatly improve
the likelihood that your changes will be merged, but you also create a document
that serves to inform future developers about the decisions made in the project.

When you notice something you would like to change about the project, open up
an issue, with "Proposal:" in the title, followed by a one-sentence description
of what you'd like to do. Use the following template for the body of the issue:

```markdown
# Problem

## {1 sentence summary of the structural problem}

{Description of the problem}

* {summary points: effects of the problem}
* {more effects}
* {yet more effects}

-------

# Proposed Solution

## {1 sentene summary of the proposed solution}

{Description of your proposed solution}

{Description of your implementation plan}

* {How it will address the points above}
* {as a list.}
```

The implementation need not be super detailed. Try listing off npm packages you will
use to implement your solution; what modules you'll likely change. You won't be held
to the specifics of your plan. It gives collaborators insight that they can use
to help you refine your solution.

**Importantly**, even if you just *suspect* that something needs to change in the
future, without having a solution in mind at present, use this template! It will
spur discussion. You don't need to include the `# Proposed Solution` part.

Finally: remember that you are talking to **peers** -- try not to make value
judgements on existing work. Statements like "X is bad" or "Y is not best
practices" are not objectively good reasons for changing code. Back up your
claims with *why*: "X prevents us from doing ABC", or "Y makes it hard for
newcomers to contribute" are much more useful points for discussion.

# Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
or similar personal characteristic.

On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
including the definition in the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/);
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
[CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/jden/CONTRIBUTING.md) core team
immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about
making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.

# Communication

There is an IRC channel on irc.freenode.net, channel `#pdxnode`. You're
welcome to drop in and ask questions, discuss bugs and such. The channel is
not currently logged.

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues
are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused
on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.
